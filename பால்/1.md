Before we begin any task, it is in Tamil Culture to say a prayer. We need Divine Grace for things to fall in the right place. We are about to enter a sacred book. We must take a few seconds to send a small prayer to the Higher Power  -***what we are about to understand should be absorbed in the right manner in our minds. We pray that this knowledge will put us on the right path in our life and we will reach our destination (Veedu) with a pleasant journey all along.***  

Parimelazhagar took up the job of writing an explanation (an explanation for a main book is called Urai) for Thirukkural. An Urai need not have any original idea. But Parimelazhagar breaks this tradition and writes an introduction for his Urai (called Urai payiram). It is very rare that an author of Urai will write an introduction, this maybe the only rarest instance.
Just as his Guru, Parimelazhagar is a man of few words. Each and every word is important. Without necessity he will not put a word. It was in the culture of Tamilians to not waste anything, even words!  

In order to understand how important it is to pay attention to every word, and how these authors have packed a ton of meaning into every word, we will, only for this section, produce a word by word meaning.   

This is the starting line on Parimelazhagar’s Urai:  

**In Tamil: இந்திரன் முதலிய இறைவர் பதங்களும்...  
Transliteration: Indiran Muthaliya Iraivar Pathangalum  
Word-to-word meaning: Indiran such as Higher Padams (Meaning - Higher Padams such as Indiran Padam)**

Explanation:  

The world is divided into living and non living things. Living things are further classified as those that can move (Sangamam in Tamil) and those that cannot move (Thavaram in Tamil). Living beings are also differentiated on the basis of the number of ways they experience the world. Humans experience world in 6 ways (touch, taste, sight, smell and hearing), the sixth sense is called manam a Sukuma sense that cannot be touched or seen but its working can be felt.  

The purpose of our current existence on this earth is to live out our karma. To live out our karma, we are blessed with a physical body. Our body is called Thanu. The effects of our past actions in the previous birth determines the kind of body we have taken in this life. Each of us have been given instruments such as nose, ear, eyes etc also called as Karunam, and we have been allotted a place to live out our karma. That is, we are born in a particular country for a specific reason. That place is called Bhuvanam. The physical objects that we are blessed with in order to live out our experiences, are called Bogam. Once our kram is over, we will leave our Thanu, Karana, Bhuvana, Bogam and move on.  

Because of the presence of Manam, man always searched for ways to better his life. He wanted to be happier than what he was yesterday. 
He searched and found that there is a state of life which is higher than our human existence, a much happier state of mind. He found that such a place is called Padam. Only happiness exists here. Many such Padams exist. Indira Padam, Brahma Padam, Shiva Padam, Vishnu Padam and so on. Man even found out how to get there.  

Only humans have that possibility of planning and becoming something better than the current existence. Eg: Humans can plan and become a Deva (a more evolved form of existence). A cow or an ant cannot think and become a human.   

So in this first line, Parimelazhagar says that, (in order to reach) Padams such as Indira Padam etc. Etc refers to other Padams. (Parimelazhagar is showing us a way to get there, in the subsequent lines)  

Now, the first line continues…   

**In Tamil: அந்தம் இல் இன்பத்து அழிவு இல் வீடும்…   
Transliteration: antham / il / inbathu / azhivu/  il / veedum  
Word-to-word meaning: Ending / no / Happiness / Destruction / no / Veedu (Meaning – (to reach a place of) Never ending and Indestructible happiness called Veedu)** 

Explanation  
Reaching Padams did not leave a man happy. When his karma was over, the existence in Padam was also over. Man was clever, he wanted a place where there was permanent, unlimited, never ending happiness. He searched hard and succeeded and found the existence of Veedu. It can be understood as our final destination. After several births, we finally reach our home.   

This is the crucial part: Veedu is roughly characterized (The exact definition for Veedu cannot be made in words. It is for each of us to experience at the end  of our journey) by two aspects a) Never ending happiness and b) a never ending place - As in, we don’t have to leave the place when the time is up. In Padams, we have to leave when our karma is over. But in Veedu there is no question of leaving. It is forever.   

So Parimelazhagr says, (In order to reach Padams) and a place called veedu, that is a place of indestructible and endless happiness…
The first line continues…  

**In Tamil: நெறி அறிந்து எய்துதற்கு உரிய மாந்தர்க்கு …   
Transliteration: neri / arinthu /eithutharkku/ uriya/ maantharkku…  
Word-to-word meaning: Moral Principles / on knowing / taking up or adopting / capable of / for humans  
(Meaning – For a human being who is capable of adopting moral Principles).**

Explanation  
A person can get rich by winning a lottery. But he will not be able to teach someone how to become rich. Only someone who has done the hard work and earned richness can give guidance to others. Similarly, some people get to Veedu by accident. Such people cannot teach others how to get there. Only someone who has planned their life in a certain way and achieved Veedu can teach others. So Parimelazhagr says, he is going to give instructions to someone who is willing and who is capable of adopting a certain set of Principles in their life. For those who are not ready to follow any Principles, this book is of no use, he says.   

The first line continues…  

**In Tamil: உறுதி என உயர்ந்தோரான் எடுக்கப்பட்ட பொருள் நான்கு. அவை அறம், பொருள், இன்பம், வீடு என்பன.  
Transliteration: uruthi/ena /uyarnthoraan/ edukkappatta/ porul/naangu./ avai/ aram / porul /inbam/ veedu/ enpana.  
Word-to-word meaning: 100% guaranteed / as / by learned / taken / topics/ four. They are/ Aram/wealth/pleasure/Veedu such as.  
(Meaning – learned elders have taken four topics, such as aram, wealth, pleasure, Veedu to guarantee Padam and Veedu  for a human being who is capable of adopting moral Principles.)**

Explanation  

Here Parimelazhagar says that learned elders have taken four broad categories under which the Principles will be laid down. We have seen the categories in the earlier FAQ section (Purudartham) as Aram, Wealth, Pleasure, Veedu.  

To sum it up, Parimelazhagar’s first two lines tell us that Learned elders have taken up four broad topics called Aram, Wealth, Pleasure, Veedu, to lay down the path that guarantees Padams such as Indiran etc and Veedu which is characterized by endless and indestructible happiness, for human beings who are capable of living a Principled life.  

This finishes the first two lines of the Introduction. We must allow allow time for the message to sink in. Just two lines need so much explanation. But that’s the way to read these books. We can jump directly into the Kurals and rush through all of them without these introductions, but that’s not going to help us much. Our Guru always says it’s alright to go slow, whatever little we read we have to get an in-depth understanding. That’s the way our ancestors taught. It’s called Marapu Kalvi (Traditional Way of transferring knowledge across generations).  

Never ending happiness, is that even possible? Isn’t happiness the ultimate goal of our search in our lives.  

Forget never-ending, even temporary happiness is not guaranteed today. Happiness is highly misunderstood but widely sought after. We have been running up and down, crossed oceans, moved to countries, tattooed pierced & injected our bodies, ran behind lust (lusting behind humans and even animals these days), ingested drugs, alcohol, killed animals and plants, and have tried so hard to fit in with the society, kicked others to climb the corporate ladder of success, squeezed ourselves to generate tons of money, spent it in a way others can see that we have it all -- all in search of happiness. Can we look around and see if there’s anyone who’s truly achieved happiness at the end of it all. We are living in an age where iconic people are falling into depression, committing suicide and dying a lonely death. We have to admit, as a human race, we really don’t know how to be happy.  

So, this piece in Parimelazhagar’s introduction is important to understand because here we have a way that guarantees 100% never ending happiness. Not ordinary happiness but a never ending one. It seems too good to be true. But, these are words of a Yogi, not some random person on the road, words that have stood the test of time. These are the kind of people who will not let even an iota of lie in their lives. Their ordinary words itself carries lot of truth. When they say “uruthi” they really mean it. They lay it down as an instructional guide for our life that will work for all human beings who are ready to live their life on certain Principles. That, is science.  

Now, Parimelazhagar continues to tell us more about Veedu. Veedu is a concept that cannot be completely understood in layman terms. Just as how we cannot measure the length of a sea using a small foot scale, we cannot describe Veedu using the words available to humans. So Thiruvalluvar did not write a separate chapter on Veedu. Then what is the use of talking about it, when even Thiruvalluvar cannot describe it or write about it ? Might as well close the book here and forget about it!   

Parimelazhagar says, even though human minds cannot comprehend the meaning of Veedu directly, the path to Veedu can be shown indirectly  - like the effect of certain cause. Eg: If someone asks me the way to Mr.X’s house. A direct response would be, “you see the tall tree, and a yellow house beside it? A dog is sleeping outside? That is Mr.X ‘s house”. Now someone asks me the way to Mr. Y’s house and I say, “You take the first right and go for about a mile, then you will see a garden. To the north of the garden is a big blue house with rose bushes in the front. The house next to the big blue house is Mr.Y’s house”.  This is showing the way indirectly.  

Thirukkural explains the process of renouncing in a chapter called “Abstinence (Thuravaram)”. When we learn to let go of our attachments in life and adopt a minimalistic living, we will automatically reach Veedu and so by explaining Abstinence he shows the path to Veedu indirectly. (Veedu comes from the Tamil root word – Vidu which means ‘to leave’. When you walk into your house you leave behind all other office work, and external world tensions. Because it is a place to leave, it is called Veedu).  

Parimelazhagar defines Aram as doing all the things that one is allowed to do and not doing the things that are prohibited, as laid out by elders such as Manu etc. Parimelazhagar acknowledges that even before Thiruvalluvar many Saints have written about Aram. There was even a book called Aram Nool which is lost over time. In Tamil Culture, whenever a person decided to master a skill - any skill (cooking, teaching, bomb-making etc), the primary lesson was to learn the Aram of the skill. He or she had to become thorough with what the skill should be used for and what things should be avoided. A skilled person had to understand the moral values first. Without this knowledge, skills were not be taught. For instance, Yoga is an ancient practice to attain Veedu (Sadly in today’s world, Yoga is poorly understood as an exercise for health, muscle power, concentration and all that. That is not the goal.) Yoga has 8 parts of which the first four are preparatory stages. The first two stages are Yama (things to do) and Niyama (Things to avoid)  - nothing but Aram. Only a person who has attained mastery in these two can enter the third stage.   

Aram was insisted because a person trained in Yoga will attain many powers (Siddhis) such as a) Anima (reducing the physical body to the size of an atom) b) Mahima (expanding the body to a large size) c) Garima (becoming heavy at will) d) Lagima (becoming weightless at will) and so on. One can become invisible and go through walls. All these are documented in detail, it’s no secret. Without the preparatory stages if one gets these powers, we can imagine the chaos that the world will be in! When reading this, if you had acquired the power to be invisible what would you do? Get the Lord’s Darshan in Thirupathi? :) …I know! That’s why we are required to learn Aram before anything.   

Even among Aram, our elders taught things that can be done prior to learning things to be avoided. You see, Among our two histories (ithihasas) Ramayanam and Mahabharatam, Ramayanam teaches us things to do and Mahabharatam teaches us how not to live. Even though Mahabharatam story is more exciting, Rayamanam holds first importance in our society. No one will teach Mahabharatam first. Even when advising children we must say “speak the truth” and not “don’t speak lies” because by repeating the word “lie” many times, the child may develop a curiosity and even a liking for it.   

 Sadly in our society, the media uses only strong negative words to describe things, that too in gory details, over and over again –eg: man slaughtered in the middle of the road, his right arm was severed and thrown aside on the pavement etc. Or movies filled with abuse, rape, and killings. When people are exposed to this over and over again, a person, out of curiosity or may think, how would it feel to do such a thing once? Our ancestors did not advice to advertise the negative things. It is not necessary because humans have a tendency to be attracted to negative emotions. But today, media likes to capitalize on people’s tastes and that’s what they reinforce, whether it is good or bad for the society is immaterial.  
 
Now, Aram has three components a) Following Principles (Ozhukkam) b) Dispute (Vazhakku) c) Punishment (Thandam). 
A person’s life has an individual component (a.k.a Ashramam) and a societal component (a.k.a. Varnam - refer FAQ). Sixteen categories can be identified and the rules differ for each group. For eg: Killing another life is acceptable for a Protector but not allowed for a Producer. Educators cannot consume meat but Protectors and Producers can. Protectors can demand tax from public but Producers cannot. 
Ozhukkam literally means ‘flowing’. It refers to, following the principles as laid out for a person’s Varnam and Ashramam. Who can we learn the principles from ? Water flows from higher ground to lower ground. Principles also should flow from people of higher values. So we should learn to look up to our elders, who are above us in values.   

The dispute resolution process is called Vazhakku. Disputes arise when a person has slipped in following the specified rules (Eg: when a Producer killed another human). Now, the case is brought for resolution. Vazhakku happens when a) someone has slipped following the rules or b) when someone lies during  interrogation. Manu Shastra lists 18 ways in which Disputes may arise.  

When the guilty is identified, Punishment (Thandam) is given to put the person back on the path of Principled life. The punishments are not at the discretion of the judge but are given as per the dictates of the Book of Law (which was written by learned people).   
Parimelazhagar raises concern that if we claim that Thirukkural is a comprehensive piece on Aram then it should have covered all three sections. But we don’t find any information on Dispute or Punishment. Parimelazhage gives two reasons: 1) Disputes and Punishments will help us in only this birth, that is, they will put us on track in this birth, whereas, Principles will put our soul’s journey on the path to Veedu. So it is more important than the other two.  2) The society that we live in will teach the other two components. So Disputes (Vazhakku) and Punishment (Thandam) are left out.  

Now, if we have decided to focus only on ‘Following Principles’ (Ozhukkam) then there should have been 16 Chapters for the 16 categories as laid out by Varnashrama Dharmam). Parimelazhagar says that Learning Age (Brahmacharyam) is atraining phase for Marriage Age (Grihastham) and Retirment age (Vanaprastham) is a training phase for the Age to let go (Sanyasam). For enacting a play many rehearsals can happen. But when the final play is staged, it is a culmination of all the rehearsals. Similarly, Thiruvalluvar has combined the Learning and Marriage phases as a single Chapter on Married Life (Illaraviyal) and Retirement and Abstinence are combined as a single Chapter on Abstinence (Thuravaraviyal).   

The first 12 years of a person’s life was allocated to learning. During the time of learning, there had to be minimal distractions, so it was necessary to keep all the senses under control to allow the mind to focus only on education. This is why education happened in Spartan conditions. Comforts (cushion seats, A/C,  tasty food etc) took a back seat to enable control of all sense organs. Nature also allowed for a distraction free learning by giving desires to humans (Kamam) at a later age. (Those people who studied only for 12 years and then went to create a family are called Boutheega Brahmacharyas and those that took up Brahmacharyam for their entire life were called Naitheega Brahmacharyas). And then when the body goes through physical changes and gets ready for procreation, the need for a partner arises. Ancestors didn’t want to waste this time by fighting against the natural urges. They created a proper system to enjoy the urges in the right way, when they arose. That’s why marriages happened early. Girls were married at the age of 12 and boys as early as 16 (As seen in Silapathiharam). This was planned to keep up with the timings set by nature.  We sow grains for paddy in monsoon. We can sow in summer but the best results are produced when we synchronize our timings with nature.   

Illaram literally means Aram for married life. The goal of marriages was not pleasure or procreation. The goal was to do Aram and reach Veedu (more on that later). Pleasure was only a secondary goal in marriages, to make life more exciting, that’s all. Because a majority of women were good at soft skills, the affairs of the house was taken up by them and men took care of the external affairs. In some cases when a man excelled at soft skills and a woman was good at external affairs, the roles were also exchanged. But regardless, Aram had to be followed in their respective roles.  

The first half of our life is filled with good changes that we can welcome easily. Our bodies grow and we acquire strength and vitality. Little preparation is necessary for these changes. The second half of our life will have unpleasant changes. We can expect decline in health, forgetfulness etc and we should be ready to take a back seat and enable the next generation to take the driver’s seat. In joint families, the daughter-in-law must be given the authority to run the household, planning the food and allocate resources. The parents-in-law were taught to take a back seat and slowly let go of responsibilities while living in the same house. This is vanaprashtam stage and it was an important stage because letting go is very difficult. It needs training.   

Joint family system used to work beautifully. People got married in their prime, were able to work hard and had the energy to have many kids. They learned to take a back seat when their kids got married. This enabled the older and younger generation to live in harmony.  There was no need for an old-age home or a day care. Fewer mental health issues were there.   

So in the Chapter on Married Life, Thiruvalluvar tells us how to live a life with a partner and in the Chapter on Abstinence he tells us how to let go.  

With this introduction, Parimelazhager leaves us at the entrance of Thirukkural. However intelligent a person is, without the blessings of the Higher Power things will not go well, even for Thiruvalluvar. So the book starts with a Prayer. The commencing Chapter is Praise of Lord (Kadavul Vaazhthu).
