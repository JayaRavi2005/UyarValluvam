## ANSWERS
### TIMELESS TREASURES

Repetition of any work over a long period of time will result in developing an expertise in the work. Because, over time many 
mistakes would have been made which would have resulted in improvisations.

Tamil civilization is one such old and highly advanced civilization. For eg: Tholkappiam is a very old Tamil scientific work 
on Tamil Grammar. It is still not clear when it was composed, at the very least it was written nearly 2000 years ago. 
For the speakers a language to bring out a book on Grammar, the language should have been in existence long before 2000 years. 
Because, grammar is nothing but a set of rules, for its speakers, that has been formulated after observing a language over a long period 
of time. Some historians say that the Tamil language has been in existence for atleast 3000 years.

Historical evidence shows that The Tamil Civilization was a fairly developed, even advanced civilization. They observed life 
over their years and made recordings in print form as to what works in life and what doesn't. They experimented with various social
& political structures, different life styles and they came to certain conclusions about what style of life will lead to happy people. 
These recordings together make our vast Tamil Literature. 

It is impossible to read and comprehend all of the written work in Tamil. Fortunately it is regarded among scholars that
Thirukkural carries the essence of ALL of Tamil’s Literary works and Thiruvasagam carries the essence of all of Shaivite Hindu Teachings.

If we look at our lives carefully, we will see that Nature protects and safeguards truth.
Whatever is not necessary, Nature removes it overnight. Nature can and has moved mountains, wiped out civilizations, created and 
destroyed species from the face of the earth. Nature Knows! She is intelligent and powerful. 

In the current age of advanced technology, nearly all of us have are equipped with latest gadgets.
Despite the increase in the RAM capacity and Gigabytes of storage available, and tons of photocopies and multiple prints of books, 
it is a ironical that always the ‘one important piece of paper’ always goes missing, just when you need it! 
It has to be undoubtedly, the power of Nature that has allowed the Thirukkural that was probably composed somewhere around 
500 BCE, that too on palm leaves, when gurus probably lived in mud houses with thatched roofs,
to be passed on to our generation without much damage. 

If we question as to why did Nature choose to preserve this document, the only obvious answer seems to be that there 
is probably something of value in it – a timeless piece of knowledge that is essential for a happy life on this earth.

What She has destroyed, it should be understood that it is not necessary for our current time period.
So if She has chosen to preserve something that is more than 2000 years old, then we should understand that there is some element of
truth in it. Maybe it has something that is necessary in our current days.

## WHAT IS ARAM
When we lie under the sky on a full moon night, with the moon and the stars above us, we realize that there is some order in nature. So many planets and  galaxies are around us, but they are all following a certain order.  If suddenly one planet removes itself from the orbit, and spins off course, the entire Universe would collapse. We are sitting here and reading this page in peace only because some order is existing in creation, whether we realize it or not.

A fish has boundaries, that is, it can thrive well in water. A bird has its boundaries and as long as it respects that boundary, it can live beautifully. The same logic goes for a flower or deep sea creatures. A deep sea creature cannot survive in shallow water and a flower dies if it is separated from the plant. As long as creation operates within its specified boundary, there is harmony.

If all these living beings (living beings with 1 sense to 5 senses) have such an order in nature, what about us, a creature with 6 senses? Do we have such an order? Is it possible to live however we please and still have a peaceful life? It’s something to think about.

If every other creation around us is able to maintain equilibrium with each other and exist in harmony, then there probably exists some order by which we, who are an equal part of creation, should live our lives, in order to live in harmony with creation. Such an order that applies to our individual lives is called as Aram or Dharmam.

## PRAMANAMS
If humans must make their own mistakes in life and learn from scratch, every single time, then there is no use in our race being blessed with six senses. If fire is hot, then it is enough if one human learns it. Others must be able to benefit from that person’s experience.
Aram refers to the rules of life embedded in Nature. But, how can anyone observe or learn these rules of life from nature? Only some things are obvious. It would be useful if someone who could observe nature, tell us what Aram is.

But, more importantly, how do we trust that person? How can we know, what that person says is true?

Our ancestors believed in accurately measuring things. Whether it was a piece of cloth or a basket of vegetables, things had to be measured. In order to measure something, we need measurement tools.

They also measured truth, that is, how can we believe that “truth” is actually 100% true? They wrote books that dealt with measurements and these books are called “Tharkka noolgal”. These formed the math portion of Tamil literature. It is also called alavai iyal (or science of measurement). These books discuss the methods used to determine the truth. (something like, how much truth is there in a sentence that I may speak). A thorough knowledge of this subject was a pre-requisite in studying Thathuvam (fundamental principles of creation). Many books on this subject are lost or destroyed and we now have only 1 or 2 with us now. The following are some introductory concepts from Sivagnana Sithiyar’s work.

Broadly, there are 10 ways of measuring truth. These ways are called Pramanams. They measured truth with Pramanam. The 10 Pramanams were condensed to the following three Pramanams:

1.    Kaatchi Pramanam (Proof of sight)
2.    Anumana Pramanam (Proof by inference)
3.    Agama Pramanam

Kaatchi Pramanam (also called kandal alavai in Tamil) is when someone uses their sense organs to identify the truth. Kaatchi  in Tamil means Sight, but Kaatchi Pramanam refers to other sense organs too. Eg: I see a cat and I say ‘there is a cat’, or I hear a girl sing and say ‘she is a good singer’, similarly for other sense organs. But this is not an accurate system of determining the truth because it depends on (a) the observer’s intelligence  and (b) the time frame of the observed action. For eg: a policeman could see a woman dead on the floor with a knife through her chest. A man is sitting near her holding the knife. It cannot be concluded that the man killed the woman. The time at which the murder happened has already elapsed.

Anumana Pramanam (also called karuthal alavai in Tamil) is determining the truth by inference. When two objects are closely related, the presence of one means that the other object is also present. For eg: the presence of smoke indicates the presence of fire. If is a person is a thief, there is a good chance that lying can also be found. This method is also not 100% accurate.

The Kaatchi Pramanam needs more explanation. There are 4 types of Kaatchi (Kaatchi in Tamil means sight).

1.    Vayir kaatchi (External Sight)
2.    Manutha kaatchi
3.    Thanvedanai kaatchi
4.    Yoga kaatchi.

To understand these, we need to understand how sense organs work. Just the presence of sense organs alone is not enough to experience the world. We need the mind to process the data sent by the sense organs. We all know that we have 5 sense organs. We have a mind that has 4 parts. They are manam (for analyzing), buthi (for confirming), ahangaram (to motiviate), and chitam (these 4 parts are also called as andha karnangal). Chitam is the base from which, and on which the other 3 parts of the mind are formed.

So. the process of seeing (hearing/smelling/touching/tasting) would involve an interaction of the mind with the external organ – let’s take the example of the eye.

This is how our ancestors understood the working of the mind and they explain:

1.    When the eye sees a rose, an image falls on the retina (this image is also called vayir kaatchi or poriyr kaatchi)and is sent to the manam (the unrecognized image in our manam is called nrivigarpa kaatchi).
2.    The job of manam is to analyze. The manam searches, in this case, it analyzes ‘is this a rose, or a cat or a chair’ against the data previously stored in the buthi.
3.    The buthi has all data recordings of not only this birth but of all the births that we have ever taken (instincts are stored here like the immediate action of an infant to turn its head to nurse). Buthi confirms that the image is that of a rose (the confirmed image in the buthi is called sarvigatpa kaatchi) and sends it back to manam (this recognized image in the manam is called manutha kaatchi).
4.    Now the manam generates a response that is either a happy or a sad one (for instance, when we see our enemy we have negative responses, a rose may generate happy response) and this response is called thanvethanai katatchi and it is felt by our Uyir (or soul).

And that is how, they say, we experience life.

We can forget about the names of all the Kaatchis and grasp only the concept.
When we are multi-tasking, even though we feel like we are doing many things at the same time, the response to the sense organs actually takes place sequentially, in our mind. But because of the speed of the mind, it appears as if we are typing and singing and listening at the same time. The job of ahangaram is to keep us motivated and prevent us from getting tired doing all this mental work.

When we engage in a slightly difficult task, like listening to music and trying to identifying a raga, or when looking at a difficult math problem and thinking of a solution, we can observe our mind doing the analyzing and confirming work.

At the end of this cognition, who or where does the final experience, positive or negative occur? They say that it is the Uyir also called Anma(soul) which is the only intelligent part of us that experiences the final result. The 4 parts of the mind and 5 sense organs do not possess any inherent intelligence. Just as how when we use spectacles or a telescope to see things, we don’t say that the spectacle or telescope has any intelligence. It is the observer’s Uyir that possesses the intelligence. The Anmauses the sense organs to see or hear or taste etc. Anma is trapped inside the body and its experience is limited to how long our eyes can see (or how far our ears can hear etc). So, if the Anma wants to experience seeing the Himalays it has to drag the body along.

Our ancestors found this as a great inconvenience. What if they could remove the Anma and allow it to experience the world? A direct experience that would not need any sense organs and body. They researched and succeeded. And that is called the Yoga Kaatchi.

That is how our ancestors found out about solar system, the process of evolution, and that the world is not flat, the stages of human embryo development, the colour of Mars (they even named it after the colour red –chevvaai) and everything other scientific discovery.

Such a person who is able to remove his Anma and allow it to integrate with nature, will be able to get a true picture of ‘Truth’. That person is a Yogi, a human  renounced of all worldly possessions. When such a person says something, it is called Agama Pramanam. Ramanar, Jesus, Prophet, Thiruvalluvar, Paramahamsar are all examples of people who had Yoga Kaatchi.

These agama pramanams are not meant to be disputed by regular humans. We do not have the capacity to argue against their words.  If what they say doesn’t make any sense, or goes against our beliefs then it can only mean that we haven’t fully understood it. It does not mean that they have made a mistake or that their words are irrelevant! Thiruvalluvar used his Yoga Kaatchi to observe Aram from nature and gave us Thirukkural. It is agama pramanam and hence has 100%  truth in it.
