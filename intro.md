## ANSWERS
### TIMELESS TREASURES

Repetition of any work over a long period of time will result in developing an expertise in the work. Because, over time many 
mistakes would have been made which would have resulted in improvisations.

Tamil civilization is one such old and highly advanced civilization. For eg: Tholkappiam is a very old Tamil scientific work 
on Tamil Grammar. It is still not clear when it was composed, at the very least it was written nearly 2000 years ago. 
For the speakers a language to bring out a book on Grammar, the language should have been in existence long before 2000 years. 
Because, grammar is nothing but a set of rules, for its speakers, that has been formulated after observing a language over a long period 
of time. Some historians say that the Tamil language has been in existence for atleast 3000 years.

Historical evidence shows that The Tamil Civilization was a fairly developed, even advanced civilization. They observed life 
over their years and made recordings in print form as to what works in life and what doesn't. They experimented with various social
& political structures, different life styles and they came to certain conclusions about what style of life will lead to happy people. 
These recordings together make our vast Tamil Literature. 

It is impossible to read and comprehend all of the written work in Tamil. Fortunately it is regarded among scholars that
Thirukkural carries the essence of ALL of Tamil’s Literary works and Thiruvasagam carries the essence of all of Shaivite Hindu Teachings.

If we look at our lives carefully, we will see that Nature protects and safeguards truth.
Whatever is not necessary, Nature removes it overnight. Nature can and has moved mountains, wiped out civilizations, created and 
destroyed species from the face of the earth. Nature Knows! She is intelligent and powerful. 

In the current age of advanced technology, nearly all of us have are equipped with latest gadgets.
Despite the increase in the RAM capacity and Gigabytes of storage available, and tons of photocopies and multiple prints of books, 
it is a ironical that always the ‘one important piece of paper’ always goes missing, just when you need it! 
It has to be undoubtedly, the power of Nature that has allowed the Thirukkural that was probably composed somewhere around 
500 BCE, that too on palm leaves, when gurus probably lived in mud houses with thatched roofs,
to be passed on to our generation without much damage. 

If we question as to why did Nature choose to preserve this document, the only obvious answer seems to be that there 
is probably something of value in it – a timeless piece of knowledge that is essential for a happy life on this earth.

What She has destroyed, it should be understood that it is not necessary for our current time period.
So if She has chosen to preserve something that is more than 2000 years old, then we should understand that there is some element of
truth in it. Maybe it has something that is necessary in our current days.
