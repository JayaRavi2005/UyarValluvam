## ANSWERS
### TIMELESS TREASURES

Repetition of any work over a long period of time will result in developing an expertise in the work. Because, over time many 
mistakes would have been made which would have resulted in improvisations.

Tamil civilization is one such old and highly advanced civilization. For eg: Tholkappiam is a very old Tamil scientific work 
on Tamil Grammar. It is still not clear when it was composed, at the very least it was written nearly 2000 years ago. 
For the speakers a language to bring out a book on Grammar, the language should have been in existence long before 2000 years. 
Because, grammar is nothing but a set of rules, for its speakers, that has been formulated after observing a language over a long period 
of time. Some historians say that the Tamil language has been in existence for atleast 3000 years.

Historical evidence shows that The Tamil Civilization was a fairly developed, even advanced civilization. They observed life 
over their years and made recordings in print form as to what works in life and what doesn't. They experimented with various social
& political structures, different life styles and they came to certain conclusions about what style of life will lead to happy people. 
These recordings together make our vast Tamil Literature. 

It is impossible to read and comprehend all of the written work in Tamil. Fortunately it is regarded among scholars that
Thirukkural carries the essence of ALL of Tamil’s Literary works and Thiruvasagam carries the essence of all of Shaivite Hindu Teachings.

If we look at our lives carefully, we will see that Nature protects and safeguards truth.
Whatever is not necessary, Nature removes it overnight. Nature can and has moved mountains, wiped out civilizations, created and 
destroyed species from the face of the earth. Nature Knows! She is intelligent and powerful. 

In the current age of advanced technology, nearly all of us have are equipped with latest gadgets.
Despite the increase in the RAM capacity and Gigabytes of storage available, and tons of photocopies and multiple prints of books, 
it is a ironical that always the ‘one important piece of paper’ always goes missing, just when you need it! 
It has to be undoubtedly, the power of Nature that has allowed the Thirukkural that was probably composed somewhere around 
500 BCE, that too on palm leaves, when gurus probably lived in mud houses with thatched roofs,
to be passed on to our generation without much damage. 

If we question as to why did Nature choose to preserve this document, the only obvious answer seems to be that there 
is probably something of value in it – a timeless piece of knowledge that is essential for a happy life on this earth.

What She has destroyed, it should be understood that it is not necessary for our current time period.
So if She has chosen to preserve something that is more than 2000 years old, then we should understand that there is some element of
truth in it. Maybe it has something that is necessary in our current days.

## WHAT IS ARAM
When we lie under the sky on a full moon night, with the moon and the stars above us, we realize that there is some order in nature. So many planets and  galaxies are around us, but they are all following a certain order.  If suddenly one planet removes itself from the orbit, and spins off course, the entire Universe would collapse. We are sitting here and reading this page in peace only because some order is existing in creation, whether we realize it or not.

A fish has boundaries, that is, it can thrive well in water. A bird has its boundaries and as long as it respects that boundary, it can live beautifully. The same logic goes for a flower or deep sea creatures. A deep sea creature cannot survive in shallow water and a flower dies if it is separated from the plant. As long as creation operates within its specified boundary, there is harmony.

If all these living beings (living beings with 1 sense to 5 senses) have such an order in nature, what about us, a creature with 6 senses? Do we have such an order? Is it possible to live however we please and still have a peaceful life? It’s something to think about.

If every other creation around us is able to maintain equilibrium with each other and exist in harmony, then there probably exists some order by which we, who are an equal part of creation, should live our lives, in order to live in harmony with creation. Such an order that applies to our individual lives is called as Aram or Dharmam.

But why should some take the effort to write a book on Aram? What was the need to tell Aram for everyone? Is it so important? 

No matter how wealthy, intelligent  and clever a person might me, a peaceful and happy life can only be had by someone who lives in the path of Aram. There can be no peaceful life for the rest.

## PRAMANAMS
If humans must make their own mistakes in life and learn from scratch, every single time, then there is no use in our race being blessed with six senses. If fire is hot, then it is enough if one human learns it. Others must be able to benefit from that person’s experience.
Aram refers to the rules of life embedded in Nature. But, how can anyone observe or learn these rules of life from nature? Only some things are obvious. It would be useful if someone who could observe nature, tell us what Aram is.

But, more importantly, how do we trust that person? How can we know, what that person says is true?

Our ancestors believed in accurately measuring things. Whether it was a piece of cloth or a basket of vegetables, things had to be measured. In order to measure something, we need measurement tools.

They also measured truth, that is, how can we believe that “truth” is actually 100% true? They wrote books that dealt with measurements and these books are called “Tharkka noolgal”. These formed the math portion of Tamil literature. It is also called alavai iyal (or science of measurement). These books discuss the methods used to determine the truth. (something like, how much truth is there in a sentence that I may speak). A thorough knowledge of this subject was a pre-requisite in studying Thathuvam (fundamental principles of creation). Many books on this subject are lost or destroyed and we now have only 1 or 2 with us now. The following are some introductory concepts from Sivagnana Sithiyar’s work.

Broadly, there are 10 ways of measuring truth. These ways are called Pramanams. They measured truth with Pramanam. The 10 Pramanams were condensed to the following three Pramanams:

1.    Kaatchi Pramanam (Proof of sight)
2.    Anumana Pramanam (Proof by inference)
3.    Agama Pramanam

Kaatchi Pramanam (also called kandal alavai in Tamil) is when someone uses their sense organs to identify the truth. Kaatchi  in Tamil means Sight, but Kaatchi Pramanam refers to other sense organs too. Eg: I see a cat and I say ‘there is a cat’, or I hear a girl sing and say ‘she is a good singer’, similarly for other sense organs. But this is not an accurate system of determining the truth because it depends on (a) the observer’s intelligence  and (b) the time frame of the observed action. For eg: a policeman could see a woman dead on the floor with a knife through her chest. A man is sitting near her holding the knife. It cannot be concluded that the man killed the woman. The time at which the murder happened has already elapsed.

Anumana Pramanam (also called karuthal alavai in Tamil) is determining the truth by inference. When two objects are closely related, the presence of one means that the other object is also present. For eg: the presence of smoke indicates the presence of fire. If is a person is a thief, there is a good chance that lying can also be found. This method is also not 100% accurate.

The Kaatchi Pramanam needs more explanation. There are 4 types of Kaatchi (Kaatchi in Tamil means sight).

1.    Vayir kaatchi (External Sight)
2.    Manutha kaatchi
3.    Thanvedanai kaatchi
4.    Yoga kaatchi.

To understand these, we need to understand how sense organs work. Just the presence of sense organs alone is not enough to experience the world. We need the mind to process the data sent by the sense organs. We all know that we have 5 sense organs. We have a mind that has 4 parts. They are manam (for analyzing), buthi (for confirming), ahangaram (to motiviate), and chitam (these 4 parts are also called as andha karnangal). Chitam is the base from which, and on which the other 3 parts of the mind are formed.

So. the process of seeing (hearing/smelling/touching/tasting) would involve an interaction of the mind with the external organ – let’s take the example of the eye.

This is how our ancestors understood the working of the mind and they explain:

1.    When the eye sees a rose, an image falls on the retina (this image is also called vayir kaatchi or poriyr kaatchi)and is sent to the manam (the unrecognized image in our manam is called nrivigarpa kaatchi).
2.    The job of manam is to analyze. The manam searches, in this case, it analyzes ‘is this a rose, or a cat or a chair’ against the data previously stored in the buthi.
3.    The buthi has all data recordings of not only this birth but of all the births that we have ever taken (instincts are stored here like the immediate action of an infant to turn its head to nurse). Buthi confirms that the image is that of a rose (the confirmed image in the buthi is called sarvigatpa kaatchi) and sends it back to manam (this recognized image in the manam is called manutha kaatchi).
4.    Now the manam generates a response that is either a happy or a sad one (for instance, when we see our enemy we have negative responses, a rose may generate happy response) and this response is called thanvethanai katatchi and it is felt by our Uyir (or soul).

And that is how, they say, we experience life.

We can forget about the names of all the Kaatchis and grasp only the concept.
When we are multi-tasking, even though we feel like we are doing many things at the same time, the response to the sense organs actually takes place sequentially, in our mind. But because of the speed of the mind, it appears as if we are typing and singing and listening at the same time. The job of ahangaram is to keep us motivated and prevent us from getting tired doing all this mental work.

When we engage in a slightly difficult task, like listening to music and trying to identifying a raga, or when looking at a difficult math problem and thinking of a solution, we can observe our mind doing the analyzing and confirming work.

At the end of this cognition, who or where does the final experience, positive or negative occur? They say that it is the Uyir also called Anma(soul) which is the only intelligent part of us that experiences the final result. The 4 parts of the mind and 5 sense organs do not possess any inherent intelligence. Just as how when we use spectacles or a telescope to see things, we don’t say that the spectacle or telescope has any intelligence. It is the observer’s Uyir that possesses the intelligence. The Anmauses the sense organs to see or hear or taste etc. Anma is trapped inside the body and its experience is limited to how long our eyes can see (or how far our ears can hear etc). So, if the Anma wants to experience seeing the Himalays it has to drag the body along.

Our ancestors found this as a great inconvenience. What if they could remove the Anma and allow it to experience the world? A direct experience that would not need any sense organs and body. They researched and succeeded. And that is called the Yoga Kaatchi.

That is how our ancestors found out about solar system, the process of evolution, and that the world is not flat, the stages of human embryo development, the colour of Mars (they even named it after the colour red –chevvaai) and everything other scientific discovery.

Such a person who is able to remove his Anma and allow it to integrate with nature, will be able to get a true picture of ‘Truth’. That person is a Yogi, a human  renounced of all worldly possessions. When such a person says something, it is called Agama Pramanam. Ramanar, Jesus, Prophet, Thiruvalluvar, Paramahamsar are all examples of people who had Yoga Kaatchi.

These agama pramanams are not meant to be disputed by regular humans. We do not have the capacity to argue against their words.  If what they say doesn’t make any sense, or goes against our beliefs then it can only mean that we haven’t fully understood it. It does not mean that they have made a mistake or that their words are irrelevant! Thiruvalluvar used his Yoga Kaatchi to observe Aram from nature and gave us Thirukkural. It is agama pramanam and hence has 100%  truth in it.

## Nameless

The preface or prologue of a book is called as “Payiram” in Tamil. In those days, there wasn’t a library or a digital catalogue to categorize books according to the subject. So the preface naturally became an important part of any book, as it gave an overview about the contents. This allowed a reader to spend her/his time wisely. The reader need not read the entire book to realize that it doesn’t fit with her area of interest.

There are certain rules to write a preface for any book. As per Nanool and Tholkappiyam (ancient books on Tamil Grammar) a preface should contain, at the least (a) the name of the author (b) the place or the conference where the book made its debut (c) the name of the chairperson under whose leadership the book made its debut, and so on. There were also criteria to decide who was qualified to write the preface. All books in Tamil literature have a Payiram in accordance to these criteria.

Thirukkural also contains a section on Payiram with 4 topics but none of them contain the required elements of the Payiram. Thiruvalluvar breaks all the rules. Interestingly, he does not even put down his name as the author of the book.

Will I (or you) ever write a book that will stand good for thousands of years and leave my name out of it? We write books to make a name for us, don’t we?! We live in a time where people don’t hesitate to steal others’ ideas and publish as their own. But, Thiruvalluvar wrote this incredible book and left his name out of it. Why ?

He didn’t mention his name because he believed that the concepts of Aram, which is what Thirukkural is about, did not belong to him. To take ownership of the book would mean the rules were his original ideas and that would amount to telling a lie. So he leaves his name out of the Masterpiece.

We have to admire the truthfulness of the poet. We should understand that he was a man who was bound by Aram. Thiruvalluvar did not create these rules of life. His job was merely to observe from nature and record them in writing. He is not the origin of Aram. Aram existed even before Thiruvalluvar wrote about it.

Let’s take this example: A child runs to play in rain while his mother warns, “if you play in the rain you will catch a fever”. The child does not listen and plays in the rain and catches a fever. Does that mean that he caught a fever because his mother said so? No, he caught a fever because he played in the rain. His mother knew this from her experience and observation. It is not her rule. Whether she observed or not, such a rule always existed in nature.

So, Aram existed in nature, long before Thiruvalluvar wrote about it. He is only an observer and so he did not record his name as the author of his work. 

## VARNASHRAMA DHARMAM
If a person decided live a solitary life in an isolated place, without interacting with anyone else, then there is no need for any kind of social structure or rules. But, when two people have decided to co-exist in a place, then both need rules for peaceful existence.

As long as I am restricted to my room, I can keep my legs wherever I want, I can be clothed or not, whatever, it’s my choice. But the minute I invite another person in my room, then both have to follow certain rules. Certain restrictions are necessary to have a peaceful life. We should understand that the restrictions apply to both people and both suffer a loss of individual freedom.

Similarly, in ancient Tamil society, when people decided to stay as a group there was a need to formulate rules. As a society too, when a rule is made, some where some group of people are losing their independent freedom in favor of the greater good. For eg: Parents lose their freedom in teaching their children. Children pick up what they see. So to impart good values to children parents make many modifications in their behavior. If we are going to fight for the lost individual freedom, the larger group will collapse. In a society we cannot have 100% freedom for all. Chanakya’s Needhi Nool (an ancient book on Political Science) also favors the idea of greater good for the greater number of people. He says that even if an individual somehow succeeds in having his individual freedom he will eventually go down when the society collapses.

But how can one formulate rules for a diverse group of beings? People differ in terms of intelligence, age and skills. You can imagine the difficulty and complexity of such a task.  How can anyone frame a set of rules that will apply to all? To do that our ancestors understood that they had to divide the people into groups, using some criteria.

But why divide? 
Let’s take the example of a school. It is not the best way to have a single hall and throw all children in a single class and have a single syllabus for all. It is also impossible to make independent syllabus for each and every student. So we have divided children into groups based on age and/or skills and then create a syllabus for each group.

Similarly, we can identify groups in the society before framing rules for them. Our ancestors thought about it and observed that society naturally progressed towards a certain kind of classification. They identified and named the classification and formulated rules for each group. Thus was born the first Dharmam (aram or rules) called Varnashrama Dharmam. A Dharmam that we, today’s learned people, have managed to drag to the witness stand with the accusation of being a forerunner of deterioration in a society. We identify it as the root cause of all the evils of caste system and the foundation of destruction of a society.

Would a society that has been so advanced in their thinking, give the name “Dharmam” to something that would deteriorate them? We should try to answer this using anumana pramanam ? If our ancestors have intentionally named a socially destructive policy as Dharma, then we can safely conclude that they were real fools and there is nothing of value to learn from them. But in all fairness, we have to see why this was created before arriving at such a conclusion. Even if we don’t wholeheartedly accept the idea, it is our duty to at the very least know what got them to form this Dharmam before we analyze with our individual minds.

The fundamental need for people is food, a basic need for survival. So a group of people with the required skill set came forward to do that task. This group formed the first pillar. They were the “Producers” (a.k.a Shudran). In today’s society, all workers who are involved in manual labor to produce goods would fall in this category. A carpenter, plumber, farmer, factory worker etc.

But, the society was not complete. Problems arose. Each person produced one or two items and there was confusion in sharing. There was a  need to distribute the goods among people. The producers were not skilled at doing this. So another group of people came forward to do that. That group was the second pillar, the “Traders” group (a.k.a Vaishyan). All current day business people would fall in this category.

Now, two problems emerged: The stronger person began to exploit the weaker. For eg, one person produced salt and another produced rice. Salt is fundamental to all food, we cannot live without salt but it takes less effort to make it. Rice on the other hand, requires more effort and it had alternatives. So salt manufactures exploited the importance of salt in the diet and they fixed exorbitant prices. Rice manufacturers suffered. Not only is their task difficult, but they could not fix high prices like salt producers, because people can live without rice.

Additionally, a physically strong person was able to extort things from the less strong sections. For instance, a physically strong man could walk in a grab another’s wife or car. He always won. So now, there was a need for a protector. Someone stronger than the strongest man. Someone to say “hey stop it, you cannot do that”. A King cannot do this job alone. He needs a support group before he can govern the people. That group was called “Protectors” (a.k.a Kshatriyan), the third pillar. That group worked for the benefit of others. In our current society soldiers, judges, lawyers, policemen etc will fall in this category.

Still problems persisted. The strength of a society lies in its intellectual advancement in all the previous groups. Otherwise economically the nation will be left behind. We all know that. So the last group of people had intellectual strength. They were good at research and advancing other areas. Their job was to make sure all other groups were most advanced in their fields. They worked to make better producers, better traders and better protectors. This group was the “Educator”, the fourth pillar. In our current society, teachers and researchers would fall in this category.

These four groups are called Varnams in Tamil and they form the four pillars supporting ANY society. 

When an object or person is useful to everyone, it commands more value. Because the protector and educator worked for the benefit of others, they automatically had more value and earned more respect. The people wanted them to have their complete focus on serving others and not be distracted by the problems of the commoners like the cost of pumpkins and the rising price of carrots and other day-to-day things. It is not possible to care about others when your own life needs are not taken care of. So there was a system of others paying for their needs. Hence emerged the system of paying taxes for the Protectors and Dakshina for educators. Since their needs were taken care of, they were able to dedicate their time to serve others.

These classifications were not meant to be carried forward by birth. That is, a producer’s child could become a protector. A trader’s child could become an educator. This was how, the original structure was framed.

Whether we name it or not, we have to agree that all countries have the above mentioned four groups.

Now also there was a confusion in creating rules for people. Any human being has two roles. An individual role and a role in the society. We have seen the four roles a person can have in the society. As an individual person too, he moves from being a baby to a child and then to a teenager to a husband,  a father,  a grandfather, a great grandfather and so on.

Can we create a single rule for all ages? For eg: There is a 3 year old, a 15 year old, a 25, 55, and 75 year old in the Educator group. Can we frame a rule for educators: don’t take interest in girls. This may apply for a 4 year old boy but what about a 25 year old man? It would be absurd. So a separation based on age was necessary.

Four stages of life was observed in a person’s life. There was an age to learn – learning age (any trade had to be learnt). Next a person seeks a partner and has a family  - family age, an age to retire  - retirement age and an age to let go of everything and search for higher goals or self actualization goals –age to let go. These four groups are called Ashrams. The names given to each age were Brahmacharyam (learning age), Grihastam (family age), Vanaprastham (retirement age) and Sanyasam (age to let go).

Now we can create a graph with the Varnams on the X axis and the Ashram on the Y axis. Our ancestors identified 16 groups of people and now they were ready for next task of framing rules for each group. 

The rules for a Producer in the learning age would be different from the rules for an Educator in the same age. The rules for a trader in the family age will be different from his rules for his retirement age.

It is our human tendency to sully every good intent, whether it is religion or electricity or internet and the Varnashrama Dharma is no exception. Our ancestors identified a natural occurrence in a society and organized it in a framework with the intention of framing rules for peaceful co-existence. We know what we have done with it today.

Using this classification as a base, later authors wrote Aram (rules) for each group. Thiruvalluvar too bases Thirukkural on Varnashrama Dharmam.

## 1330 Couplets based on Purudartham

We can imagine how big, a book that gives instructions on life should be. But, Thirukkural’s instructions total 1330 couplets with seven words per couplet. How is it possible to condense our entire life in one book?

The contents of the book are organized in line with our daily activities. If we list down ALL the activities we perform in a single day of our life, they will fall into one of the following categories: 1) Aram/ Dharma activities (helping others, keeping ourselves clean etc), 2) Wealth seeking activities, 3) Pleasure seeking activities, 4) Activities towards Self actualization. There cannot be a fourth category. This classification is called Purudartham or Purushartham in Sanskrit.  

Thirukkural has a set of instructions for the first three, in three broad sections called **Paal-s** they are,  
1) Arathu Paal -  This section discusses the aram in how a husband and wife can live a happy life and perform good deeds.
2) Porut Paal - This section discusses the aram in how a couple can earn money to do those good deeds.
3) Inbathu Paal - To keep them motivated, the couple engage in pleasure activities. This section discusses the related arams. 
4) Self Actualization - Valluvar does not have a section for the fourth activity because performing the above three activities in the right way will automatically lead a person to self actualization (more on that later).  

Aram has three components: a) Instructions for right path b) Dispute resolution that will be needed when people slip from the right path (vazhakku in Tamil) c) Remedial actions (punishments, or thandam in Tamil) to put people  back on track. Parts b and c do not instruct people about leading a good life, so Thiruvalluvar ignores them and focuses only on Aram.  

All humans go through four personal stages (Learning age, Family Age, Retirement Age, and Age for Self Actualization) and take up one of the four social roles (producer, trader, protector, and educator). Thirukkural talks about Aram that applies to all four social roles. As for the personal roles, he says that the Learning Age (Brahmacharyam) is a preparation for Family life (Grihastham). We all get an education to earn money to hopefully have a good family. Similarly, the Retirement age (Vanaprastham) is a preparation for Self Actualization (Sanyasam). When we retire, we learn to let go of things while we are still in a family life. This will prepare us to let go of other attachments to reach our final destination (Permanent Happiness).  

So he combines the instructions for learning age and family age and under the tile Family Portion (Illarav-iyal), and combines instructions for Retirement age and Self Actualization age under a common heading Self Actualization Portion (Thuravarav-iyal).
With that the portion of Arathu-Paal comes to an end. It is followed by Porut-Paal and Inbathu paal.  

It is not possible to eat an entire cake without cutting it into smaller pieces. Similarly, Thirukkural has been subdivided into smaller sections (called Paal, Iyal,  and Athigaram ) and organized in a manner that follows a human’s natural progression in life. The book has three major parts called Paal-s in accordance with Purudartham. Each Paal  is further divided into subsections called Iyal-s. Each Iyal is divided into smaller sections called Athigarams and each Athigaram has 10 couplets called Kurals. Each Kural has 7 words, 4 in the first line and 3 in the second line. Thus, we have a total of 1330 Kurals.  
 
And that is how, Thiruvalluvar condenses the instructions for our entire life in one book, in 1330 couplets (Kurals).
