### Short Explanation  
Rain causes hardship (during draught) but it also gives back in equal amount whatever it took away.  

### Detailed Explanation 
Sometimes Rain causes hardship by its absence. What about hardships during floods and hurricanes, when it rains in excess?  

Parimelazhagar clarifies that the Kural refers only to the hardships brought out by draught. There are some species in this planet that can survive only by consuming a large quantity of water once a year, sometimes even once in two years. For such species, God creates floods. Even though many of the other smaller plants get washed away in floods, some trees like Banyan etc require that much water and hence that one flood is necessary. Hence Valluvar doesn’t use the term hardships to refer to excess of rain.  

On the other hand, a draught will cause problem for all species of life. So here, the hardship referred to is the one brought about by draught.   

Whatever that Rain takes away by its absence, it will bring back when it next rains.  

A mother disciplines her child sometimes harshly. But she doesn’t kill her child. Similarly, rain creates a temporary inconvenience but it will always come back (Such is also the kindness of God). It is with such hope that farmers are continuing to do their job.
