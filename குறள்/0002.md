### Short Explanation

What is the use of learning, if it doesn’t make the learner worship the Purely Wise One’s (God’s) Feet.   

### Detailed Explanation   

This Kural gives us the goal of Education.  

So, does this mean that we have to pursue some religious learning and that is the only real education? And is the goal of such a real education, to touch God’s feet ?  
-- Not at all.  

Parimelazhagar explains that there are six stages in education. A person may go through these stages in the previous birth and continue from where they left off in this birth.  
1. Education
2. Intelligence
3. Good habits
4. Love
5. Compassion
6. Mukti  

He says any education, whether it is Physics or Chemistry or English or Arts must lead us to Intelligence. What is the difference between [education and intelligence?](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam/blob/master/%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D/0002.md#education-and-intelligence).  
Education can land us in one of the following three possibilities:  

1) Doubt or Ayyam in Tamil (eg: the answer of 2+2 is 4 or 5??)  
2) Incorrect understanding or Thiribu in Tamil (eg: confirming that the answer of 2+2 is 5)  
3) Clarity or Thelivu in Tamil (Eg: the answer of 2+2 is 4)  

A person has to cross doubt and incorrect understanding to reach clarity. We need the Divine Grace to be able receive education in the right way – to result in clarity. A person in doubt can be helped, but a person with a wrong understanding is difficult to correct. 
A right form of education must land the learner in clarity. Such an education will lead to intelligence.  

Valluvar says that once we reach intelligence we should learn to let go of education.  

An example: If there is a dirty brass pot, we usually use tamarind and sand to clean it. After cleaning, the shine of the brass is restored. The shine did not come from the tamarind, it came from the pot. Now after cleaning the pot, we must remove the residue tamarind and sand. If we decide to leave the tamarind on the pot just because it produced the shine, the pot will become even dirtier than before. Similarly, we use education to polish our minds to make intelligence shine through. Once the shine is achieved, we should get rid of the education. Otherwise it will give us a huge ego! When sweeping the house with a broom stick, we collect the dust and put the broomstick away. We don’t keep the broom in the middle of the hall. We keep it in a corner, where it belongs. Education is like the broom stick.  

What’s after intelligence?  
Intelligence must lead a learner to Good Habits (Ozhukkam in Tamil).  An education without good habits is considered useless.  

What should Good Habits lead us to?
Good habits in a person must lead to Love. Our habits must lead to mutual tolerance and respect for each other’s values. This will eventually lead to care and love.  

What should love lead us to?  
Love must lead to compassion. Love is when we care about people who are known to us, like our family and friends. When our child falls down, our heart leaps and we run to help. When we are able to extend such care for people unknown to us, that is called compassion (Arul in Tamil). Our love should lead us to Arul.  

What’s after Arul?  
Compassion (Arul) will lead us to give our things for the betterment of others. We will learn to release our attachments - which is the path to Veedu or God or Mukti.  

After Mukti?  
That’s it. That’s the end of our journey.  

This is the route they have charted for education.  

Becoming a doctor or an engineer etc are only the side benefits. When going to the church or temple, we buy ice-cream and pop corn on the way. The main goal is to pray, the side benefits are the ice cream and pop-corn.  

Any education that does not take us down this path, is considered useless. We can get money and fame from such a retarded model, but happiness cannot be had unless our education gets converted to intelligence and to good habits, to love and finally to compassion. And remember, Valluvar is not talking about religious education. Any subject, he says, when we go to the depth of the field, we will be faced with questions which will take us in this path.  

In any society, those in the higher stage of education (as explained above) will automatically be respected than those in the levels below. An intelligent person will command more respect than an educated person. Similarly, a man with good habits will command more respect than an educated person. A man with compassion will be highly regarded than an educated person. Eg: Political leader Kamarajar, an ex-chief minister of Madras Province, was a true leader. He dropped out of school at an early age to support his mother. But even today, he holds a special place in his people’s hearts because he truly cared for his people.  

We are used to showing love for things that reciprocate our love (Plants, animals, other humans). Is it possible to show compassion towards something that doesn’t reciprocate? In Thiruthondarpuranam or Periyapuranam by Arumuga Navalar, which is a compilation of the lives of devotees of Shiva, we see  Kannappar who had compassion for a stone! This is a quality that is highly regarded. It is said that Kannappar, who was uneducated, attained Mukti in six days, while Navukkarasar, a highly educated devotee, attained Mukti only at the age of 81. So we should understand that education can also stand in the way of our final goal. At some point we should let go of it.
So that’s the meaning of Kural 2. What is the use of education, that does not help us to reach the pure feet of God.  

In this Kural, there is a mention of feet of God. Hence this refers to the [Uruvam](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam/blob/master/%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D/0002.md#aruvam-aru-uruvam-and-uruvam) level of worship.  

## Explanations
### Education and Intelligence
As a rough explanation we can say that Education is what goes inside our mind and Intelligence is what comes out, as result.
Eg: Swami Vivekananda was a very highly educated man. It is said that he had an X-Ray memory. He only had to flip through a book and all the contents would be uploaded in his memory. His guru was Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsar – a man who did not even complete his village school education. Vivekananda says about his Guru “we ordinary people like to quote wise men’s words, but Paramahamsar’s  words are quotes by itself”. That is the difference between education and intelligence.

 ### Aruvam, Aru-Uruvam and Uruvam
Broadly speaking, Siddhantam says that God has two states of being. 
1.	Swaroopam
2.	Thadathai  
     a. Aruvam  
     b.	Aru-uruvam  
     c.	Uruvam  
     
The first state is called Swaroopam. This is the truest form, which humans cannot comprehend and hence cannot be described by words. We cannot measure an ocean using a small cup. So it is not possible to describe the Superior Power using our limited language. It is for each of us to experience at the end of our journey. We must first accept the presence of such a power. Whether it is Jesus, or Allah or Nature, it exists, that’s all.  

Then what is the use of such a God who can neither be understood nor be described?  
He has another state of being called Thadathai which humans can describe in their vocabulary. In Thadathai, God comes down in three different forms for humans to understand.  

At the first level God comes down in the formless state for those people who are high on logic and reasoning. They don’t need a form or a shape to understand things. Their brain works differently, they find it comfortable to believe that God is everywhere, and there is no need for a temple or statue that would limit His presence. For them God comes down in the formless state. This state of God is called Aruvam state (Aruva Nilai in Tamil). Such a worship is called Aruvam worship. People on the Yogam Path worship God in the Aruvam state.  
At the second level God comes down in a semi-form state. This is for people for whom it is necessary to have some form, not necessarily a human form, something like the Lingam or a cross – a symbolic representation. This is called the Aru-Uruvam style of worship.  

At the third level, God comes down in a worldly form. This is for people who need a form that they can relate to. Maybe the form of a child that reminds us of innocence and joy, or the form of a cow that is soft and gentle, or the form of a powerful woman to remind of the power beyond us. We need to see that form physically, to believe in it. That kind of worship is called Uruvam worship (Uruvam means ‘form or shape’ in Tamil).   

It is below the first and second level, in terms of closeness to the final swaroopam level, but it is not wrong. People in the [Sariyai and Kiriyai](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam/blob/master/%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D/0002.md#sariyai-kiriyai-yogam-gnanam) path tend to worship God in Uruvam and aru-uruvam states.  

In the first kural, Thiruvalluvar mentions that God is everywhere. He didn’t specify any shape or place so he is referring to a formless God.  Parimelazhagar points to us that, this is the first level or the Aruvam level of worship (In the subsequent Kurals the other levels will be introduced). The second Kural mentions the feet of God, hence it is a Uruvam level of worship.  

### Sariyai, Kiriyai, Yogam, Gnanam  

People are of different kinds. We see differences even between siblings, husbands and wives, parents and children. For some of us, logic and reasoning are the driving force in life. For some of us, our emotions rule our lives. Is it possible then, to have a single way of approaching God ?  
Eg: Imagine a school that had only one class, one lesson plan and one teacher for all students. This school admits students from the age of five to ninety all in the same class. How effective will the teaching be? Siddhantham didn’t believe it was a good idea, so they put forth a four step approach.  

They said that all worship will have to start with the external worship. It is impossible for someone to just close their eyes and be one with God without prior training in the external worship method. If someone is able to do that, it means they have had such a training in their previous birth.  

The four steps of worship are:
1) External worship Or Sariyai  
2) External-Internal Worship - Or Kiriyai  
3) Fully Internal Worship or Yogam and  
4) Becoming one with the Supreme or Gnanam.  

The following example will help understand better. In many families we will see the parents tell the children to fold their hands or kneel down and pray. The child will do it automatically without understanding the meaning. Many youngsters are also like this. While going in the bike or cycle when they come across a temple, they will gently bow and give a cursory salute. This is the external form or Sariyai worship and there is nothing wrong with it. It is a necessary first step.  

Now imagine that the child grows up, and gets married and is expecting his first child. Now the pregnant wife is in the operation theater and the doctor says that the situation is critical and only one life can be saved. The young husband goes to the church/temple and with folded arms and tears in eyes asks God to save both lives. His relationship with the Almighty just deepened. The mind which gave a cursory bow to the idol now touches a new meaning behind the idol. Now, he has touched the next level. This is the Kiriyai level of worship, where the external worship touches the internal worship.  

At the third level, there is no need for a picture or idol of God. A person can simply sit and close their eyes, and the temple comes to them. This is Yogam.  

The final destination is Gnanam wherein comes the oneness with the Supreme Power. This will lead one to Veedu.
