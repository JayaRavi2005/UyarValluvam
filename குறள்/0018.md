### Short Explanation  
If it doesn’t rain, the special poojas like the Thiruvizha cannot happen.  

### Detailed Explanation 
Why does Valluvar talk about poojas?  
In the previous Kurals, Valluvar made it clear that the world cannot function without rain. What about the Devas and the Pitrs? Devas & Pitrs can be understood as the celestial beings in a higher vibrational plane. Devas grant boons to humans and they take care of us. These things cannot be proved in a lab. If Valluvar says they are present, we have to believe him, that’s all.  

There are two kinds of poojas (prayer ceremony) performed in temples. One is the daily pooja also called as Nithiyam and the other is the annual pooja called Nai Nithiyam pooja. In the daily pooja there is a possibility of things going wrong such as lack of flowers or lack of other pooja items. So to make a solid good pooja without any flaws, temples follow the practice of having one big pooja in a year. A lot of care will be taken to make sure nothing goes wrong. All pooja protocols will be carefully observed. This is the Thiruvizha or the special pooja or the Nai Nithiyam Pooja. But what is the use of this?  

During these Poojas, priests will make offerings of food, saree and other things in the sacred fire. This will be received by the Devas. The mental thought that Devas should receive it, is enough for such a transaction. Without our offerings, Devas will not receive food. God has created such a structure so that we humans will be tightly linked with Devas. They grant us boons and we give them food.
You see, in our youth we will have a lot of physical stamina but not enough life experience. When we get old we will have a lot of experience but not enough physical strength. This is structured so because only then old and young people can live together harmoniously as they will benefit from each other. Following this tradition, in Tamil culture parents will always live with their children.
Without rain people will not have enough money to perform all these poojas. Hence not only will humans suffer in the earth plane, but even Devas and Pitrs will suffer in the higher vibrational planes.  

One more important point is shown in this Kural about Tamil culture -the importance of order. Higher valued things will be given importance first. In a wedding, elders and learned people will be given front row seats. If there is a public gathering a learned person will be given special respect and made to sit in the front. Ordinary people will take a back seat. This is done to motivate the regular people to achieve higher goals. The ordinary person will aspire to live a good life to get that respect. These days we have messed up this practice, a thief is taking the front row and a judge is sitting in the last row, and we are okay with that. In the name of equality we are treating everyone - educated, uneducated, cultured, well-mannered, ill-mannered, all uniformly, without any difference. That will not serve the purpose of motivating the individuals in the society to become a better person.  

 Note in the Kural, “sirapodu poosanai…” first “sirappu” (sirappu meaning special pooja and odu means along with) is mentioned and then “Pooja” (referring to daily pooja) is mentioned. The higher valued Pooja is mentioned first.  
 
So the Kural says, without rain special poojas and ordinary poojas will also be hindered.
