### Short Explanation  
The mighty ocean’s natural tendency will be reduced if the clouds that have directly absorbed the water (in the form of a water spout or vapour) fail to give rain.  

### Detailed Explanation 
In the previous Kural, Valluvar said that rain is important to even the smallest of living things (blade of grass). In this Kural he says that rain is important even for the mighty ocean.  

Whenever we are stressing the importance of anything we have to specify the importance for the tiniest and the mightiest. Then the magnitude of the importance will be well understood. So he has touched the importance for both the lowest of creation and highest of creation, in these two Kurals.  

Sometimes we may have observed that water will be directly absorbed from the sea by the clouds, like a pillar of water. This is called waterspout. Sometimes even fish will be absorbed along with and we have witnessed fish rain! The word “thadinthu” means “to smell it in like a long inhale”. So it refers to the waterspout. Some people also understand it as water vapor, which is also correct.
 So when the sea water that is absorbed by the clouds, doesn’t come down as rain what would happen to the sea?  
 
Sea organisms will not grow because the salt content will increase and will become unsuitable to sustain life. Many shells and rare minerals will not be formed. It is said that pearl will be formed only during Swati nakshatram, when the oyster comes to the surface and opens its mouth and a drop of water enters the shell. It is a rare event as it is, without rain it will become extinct.  

Even though the foundation of rain is sea, the mighty ocean will lose its natural tendency without rain.
With these 7 kurals (11 to 17) the importance of rain for the earth has been established. The next Kural will deal with a different subject.
